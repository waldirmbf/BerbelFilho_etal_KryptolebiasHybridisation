# **Genetic and epigenetic signatures of hybridisation between _Kryptolebias_ species**

This repository contains the scripts (and related files) for genetic and epigenetic analysis 
(using methylation-sensitve genotyping by sequencing) used while investigating the hybridisation 
between _Kryptolebias ocellatus_ and _Kryptolebias hermaphroditus_ in southeast Brazil. 
More detailed information can be found at Berbel-Filho et al. (XXXX).
