# **Genetic and epigenetic signatures of hybridisation between _Kryptolebias_ species**

This repository contains the scripts (and related files) for genetic and epigenetic analysis used while investigating the hybridisation
between _Kryptolebias ocellatus_ and _Kryptolebias hermaphroditus_ in southeast Brazil.
More detailed information can be found at the preprint manuscript [Berbel-Filho et al. (2020)](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.01.182022v1.full).
